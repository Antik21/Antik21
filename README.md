### 🚀 Breaking Barriers with ChatGPT:
Recently, I started using **ChatGPT**, and it completely changed the way I work:
- **Multi-language Development**: I now code not only in **Java** and **Kotlin** but also in **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Rust**, **Swift**, and other languages.
- **Bringing Ideas to Life**: ChatGPT has eliminated language barriers, enabling me to create solutions regardless of the programming language.
